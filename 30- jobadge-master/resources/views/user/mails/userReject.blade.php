    <p>Dear <span class="color-red">{{$userJob->user->first_name}}</span></p>
    <p> 
        We appreciate your interest in <span class="color-red">{{$userJob->job->company->name}}</span>
        and the time youâ€™ve invested in applying for the <span class="color-red">{{ $userJob->job->title }}</span>
       .
    </p>
    <p>Refusing does not mean you are not good, you are not rejected without reasons, you are rejected compared to current requirements .</p>
    <p>Rejecting may be just a correction of your situation where you belong, and lets you focus on the best you can do.</p>
    <p>Recharge your energy again and be accomplished.</p>
    <p>Thanks, Valued Jobseeker</p>
