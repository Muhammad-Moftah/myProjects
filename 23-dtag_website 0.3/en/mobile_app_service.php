                        <h3>1- Cross-Platform Development:</h3>
                        <p>An app developed to target multiple platforms, with the goal of "write once, run anywhere" - sharing as much code as possible between platforms.</p>
                        <p>Cross-platform development for mobile platforms is often a good way to cut development costs and brings your solution to the market faster. By developing a cross-platform app you make it immediately available on all major platforms, including iOS, Android, Windows Phone, and more.</p>
                        <p>We have invested in building best-in-class competency in cross platform app development to enable our clients invest their resources in seamless, high quality engagement through mobile (not worrying about native versus hybrid / iOS versus Android / touchscreen versus querty versus stylus / screen size and resolution / camera and sound).</p>
                        <p>Our highly skilled mobile developers are well-versed in the modern cross-platform tech stack, including PhoneGap, Xamarin, and React Native, and will help you build your app on time and on budget.</p>
                        <h3>2- Native-Platform Development:</h3>
                        <p>Native app is an app developed specifically for a single platform. To support both iOS and Android, two separate apps are developed. Functionality and appearance will largely be the same for both platforms, although tailored to each.</p>
                        <p>If you need complex computations or CPU-intensive animations, building a native app for each platform may be your best bet. Native code will ensure the best possible performance and hence the optimal UX.</p>
                        <p><span>Android: </span> Our android app developers are skilled, certified and follow Agile methodologies, implementing Android app development best practices and offering enterprise level development.
